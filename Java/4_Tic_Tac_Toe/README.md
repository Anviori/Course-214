Algorithms and Datastructures fourth assginment. This assignment introduces
Trees using recursion to build a Tic Tac Toe AI that cannot lose. 

- The entire game tree (a 9-ary tree) is built initially 
(as soon as the program starts). It is done recursively. 

- Each node of the game tree is a different possible move depending on what move
the root is.
