Introduction:

In this project, an edge List is used to create an Adjacency list to represent a
graph.

The vertices of the graph are taken from an input file that specifies the 
number of vertices and the neighbors of each vertices (with their respective 
weight).
The Vertices are printed to ensure the graph was properly constructed. 

Next, for the graph, a depth first and breadth first traversal was done and 
printed.

Lastly, Dijktras shortes path algorithm was implemented to print the shorted 
path and weight from vertex 0 to all other vertices.
