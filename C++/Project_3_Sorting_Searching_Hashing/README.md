Sorting and Searching:
	(1) Quicksort algorithm
	(2) Heap-sort algorithm

	a. Generate 5000 integer random numbers in the range 0 to 10^6 and store 
    	   them in an array. 
	
	b. Sort the array using Quicksort and Heaps-sort  and find the number of
	   comparison operations in each case and print it.
	
	c. Repeat steps (a) and (b) above 30 times, and find the minimum, maximum,   
           mean, median, and standard deviation of the number of comparison 
           operations, for the two methods.

2.	Hashing: 
	
	(1): 

	- Implement a Hash Table based on chaining for collision resolution. 
	- Choose your own hash function. 
	- Evaluate its performance using the following steps:
	
	a. 
		- Generate 5000 integer random numbers in the range 0 to 9,999, insert 
        	them into a hash table of approximate size 1021, and find the number of 
        	collisions and comparisons. 
		
		- Sort the chains or lists. When you insert a new key,
		insert it so that the list remains sorted in ascending order. 

		- If the key is already present in the list, then it is not inserted 
		(only one copy of each key is maintained). 

		- Count the number of collisions and comparison operations during 
        	insertion, and find the average number of collisions and comparisons for 
        	5000 insertions.

	b. 
		- Repeat step (a) above 10 times, and find the average number of 
        	collisions and comparisons over 10 trials.
