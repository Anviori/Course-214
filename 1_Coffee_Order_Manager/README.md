COFFEE ORDER MANAGER

Introduction:

Algorithms and Datastructures first assginment. Creating a program that 
introduces the use of linked lists. This program uses a doubly linked list 
to keep track of the orders of two baristas (two lists) for a coffee shop; a cursor
is also implemented.

- The orders can be added to the end of the list, the 
front, or the middle. 

- The orders can be deleted, moved around (copy, paste, move the cursor), and
switched between baristas.

- Orders of the same type can be put next to each other.
